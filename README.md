# Book List

This is a project based on a technical frontend assessment. It is made in React with Vite and this litle app has the following features:

* Show a list of books availables in the library
* We can filter the books to find what we're looking for
* We can add a book to a reading list
* We can delete a book from the reading list

This project is only for practicing. I wil intend to develop a project like this every week to be prepared for technical interviews and frontend challenges.

### Tech stack
